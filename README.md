# Repo-Python
It is an events Repository I made in python

1. The first thing you need is a MySql service mounted on your localhost.
2. You will need to create the database structure, according to the "Dml Sentences" text file.
3. The next thing you'll need is to edit the connection.py file, to satisfy your needs and adapt to your own MySql service
4. You will need to install Two libraries more: Pillow and mySql-connector-python from your favorite shell, this way:
    - pip install pillow
    - pip install mySql-connector-python
5. You are ready, just open the Repo.pyw file and enjoy!

note: by default you'll have to access as "admin" and password "admin"
